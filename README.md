# Simulation program for the analysis of multilayer media

The main goal of this program is computation of reflectance, transmittance and absorption coefficient
of multilayer media depending on materials characteristics (absolute permittivity and thicknesses of layers),
wavelength of light in vacuum and angle of incidence of light.

The program is able to get necessary data through GUI or read it from file. The output can be represented as graph of
dependence of the parameter on the angle of incidence or wavelength (or both). Also the program is able to write
the data to file which is calculated with required precision.

GUI of the program includes visualization of the layers and interaction with them.
